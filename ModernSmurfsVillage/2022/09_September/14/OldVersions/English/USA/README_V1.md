## Didn't play.

I am taking another hiatus from this game, as I didn't want to continue playing this game today.

I haven't played since 2021 September 3rd (`376 days ago`) (Double checked as of 2022, Monday, September 5th, last tested on 2022, Monday, September 5th, [[`click here to view the current amount (DuckDuckGo link)`]](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=Days+since+September+3rd+2021&t=ffab&ia=answer) I currently don't have interest in resuming daily games at night, but I should at some point.

## When will you come back?

I have no idea. I hope to come back soon when I can find the time and interest again. I am not giving up hope yet. Due to new rules in the past 2 months, when I do come back, images won't be uploaded here, only status posts will be uploaded here.
