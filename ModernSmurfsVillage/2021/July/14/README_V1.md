# Session 14

## July 14th 2021

I played the game again today in the early afternoon, and had a average length session past midnight.

<!-- Session notes July 8th 2021

!-->

### Early session

I had a short pre-session today, and began harvesting golden corn, and beginning to grow more golden corn. I also grew some potatoes for a quest, did some remodeling, leveled up to level 19, and built a new hut and did some upgrades to it, and 1 other hut. The scavenger hunt glitched out, and I can't complete the current objective.

### Midnight session

I had a shortened midnight session tonight.

### Crops

I grew a small variety of crops today, and made over 10000 coins from the production of golden corn. I got a profit upgrade to golden corn crops recently, so I will now be making more per crop.

### Animal sanctuary

I was snooping around several days and found out that I was capable of unlocking the animal sanctuary. I used it a little bit today, and made minor progress.

### Visual effects

I turned visual effects back on today. I keep turning them on and off.

### Tile change

I changed my profile tile today to mix things up. I noticed a while ago that most of the games old UI appears when you go to this menu.

### Remodeling

I did significant remodeling to the animal sanctuary yesterday. It looks a lot nicer now. I didn't do any remodeling to it today.

### Short on coins

I spent many coins on quests and objectives several days ago, and getting my village to look better. I am now very short on coins, and I am trying to stock more coins up.

As of recently, I have stocked up thousands of coins from crop growing, but I keep blowing them instead od saving them up.

### Bridge

7 days ago (on Thursday, July 8th 2021), I began construction on a long bridge to reach the beach area. 6 days ago, on Friday, July 9th 2021, I unlocked the beach area, and started working on it.

### Population

I reached a population of 54-55 today, I can't currently determine the exact population.

### Ad problem

There is a new format of ads that started upon playing this game that I don't like (I already don't like most mobile ads to begin with, but this format is incredibly annoying) it takes me to a website that I can't navigate, sometimes the ads themselves won't load, and it will make me watch the same thing 4 times in a row, giving me the option to skip every 10 seconds. It is an extremely malicious and abusive ad format, and I question its legitimacy other than just farming ads. The site it keeps redirecting me to makes me feel like I have bad malware on my device.

There was a lesser bad format, which is literally just using PodCasts, and Soundcloud as an ad platform, which I feel is a violation of their usage. These aren't as bad, as I can just mute them, but they are still a violation of ad policies.

The issue wasn't as bad on July 9th 2021

The issue did not return on July 10th 2021

The issue returned tonight. - July 11th 2021

The issue did not return today - July 12th 2021

The issue returned today - July 13th 2021

The issue returned again today - July 14th 2021

### Level progress

<!-- I leveled up to level 18 today. !-->

I leveled up to level 19 today, and used an ad boost to get additional XP to level up, so that I could progress through level 19 slightly faster (3% faster)

<!-- I did not level up today. !-->
