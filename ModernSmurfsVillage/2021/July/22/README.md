I played the game again today in the early afternoon briefly, and had a slightly longer session at night,

<!-- Session notes July 8th 2021

!-->

### Early session

I had a shoter pre-session today, where I began harvesting golden corn and potatoes, and also did general collection. I also played several minigames. I did not grow raspberries, and I did some remodeling. I leveled up to level 23, and built my first blue mushroom hut, and made minor progress.

I unlocked magic shrubs recently, using my first one to test it out. I now have 6 of them (as of July 22nd 2021)

### Midnight session

I didn't do much tonight, but I made some progress in the level. I did some remodeling and spent all my coins again, creating a little desert area.

### Crops

I grew a small variety of crops today, and made over 8000 coins from the production of golden corn. I got a profit upgrade to golden corn crops recently, so I will now be making more per crop.

I turned visual effects back on today. I keep turning them on and off. Lately, as of the past 6 days, I have just kept them on. - July 22nd 2021

### Tile change

I changed my profile tile yet again today to mix things up. I noticed a while ago that most of the games old UI appears when you go to this menu.

### Remodeling

I finally finished my beachside flower lane remodel idea, costing me tens of thousands of coins. It is finally finished. - July 18th 2021

I made a little desert area on the cliff today, and also began using rope bridges for the first time. - July 22nd 2021

### Short on coins

I spent many coins on quests and objectives several days ago, and getting my village to look better. I am now very short on coins, and I am trying to stock more coins up.

As of recently, I have stocked up thousands of coins from crop growing, but I keep blowing them instead of saving them up. This wasn't a problem until I spent over 30000 coins today. I still am working on stocking up again.

This section is rarely updated and doesn't have new data to represent today. - July 22nd 2021

### Bridge

No recent bridge progress to display. (As of July 22nd 2021)

### Stairs

I began to build stairs today in the early afternoon, so that I can unlock the cliff region. It will be ready in tonights session. - July 21st 2021

Later on, in my nighttime session, I built the maximum amount of staircases to get it out of the way. - July 21st 2021

No new stairs data. - As of July 22nd 2021

### Population

I reached a population of 75/73 today, I can't currently determine the exact population, as it seems to be off by 2. - July 21st 2021

I managed to upgrade all my mushroom huts to level 3 today, now I can keep on top of it, and use smurfberries for other upgrades. - July 21st 2021

### Ad problem

There is a new format of ads that started upon playing this game that I don't like (I already don't like most mobile ads to begin with, but this format is incredibly annoying) it takes me to a website that I can't navigate, sometimes the ads themselves won't load, and it will make me watch the same thing 4 times in a row, giving me the option to skip every 10 seconds. It is an extremely malicious and abusive ad format, and I question its legitimacy other than just farming ads. The site it keeps redirecting me to makes me feel like I have bad malware on my device.

There was a lesser bad format, which is literally just using PodCasts, and Soundcloud as an ad platform, which I feel is a violation of their usage. These aren't as bad, as I can just mute them, but they are still a violation of ad policies.

The issue wasn't as bad on July 9th 2021
