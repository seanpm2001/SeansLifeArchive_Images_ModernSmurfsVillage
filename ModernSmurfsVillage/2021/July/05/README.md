# Session 5

## July 5th 2021

I played the game again today at night, technically on July 6th 2021.

### Early session

I had a pre-session today at around 11:00 am to do brief collection, and to start growing strawberries for quests.

### Midnight session

I had a slightly longer session tonight. I did several objectives, minigames, and collection. I also started to grow Potatoes before quitting.

### Tile change

I did not change my profile tile today.

### Short on coins

I spent many coins on quests and objectives yesterday, and getting my village to look better. I am now very short on coins, and I am trying to stock more coins up.

### Level progress

I leveled up to level 14 today.
