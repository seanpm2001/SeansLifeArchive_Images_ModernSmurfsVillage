## July 8th 2021

I played the game again today at night, technically on July 8th and July 9th 2021.

### Early session

I had a short pre-session today, and began growing golden corn, and also some collection.

### Midnight session

I had a longer session tonight. I did several objectives, minigames, and collection. I also started to grow Golden Corn before quitting.

### Crops

I grew a small variety of crops today, and made over 10000 coins from the production of golden corn.

### Visual effects

I turned visual effects back on today. I keep turning them on and off.

### Tile change

I changed my profile tile again today to change things up. I noticed that most of the games old UI appears when you go to this menu.

### Short on coins

I spent many coins on quests and objectives a few days ago, and getting my village to look better. I am now very short on coins, and I am trying to stock more coins up.

As of recently, I have stocked up thousands of coins from crop growing.

### Population

I reached a population of 41-44 today, I can't currently determine the exact population.

### Ad problem

There was a new format of ads today that I highly disliked, and see as extremely ineffective and incredibly annoying. The screenshots will go into more detail on this.

### Level progress

<!-- I leveled up to level 14 today. !-->

I leveled up to level 16 today. I watched an ad to get the last 3 percent, at least it wasn't like the bad ads earlier.

<!-- I did not level up today. !-->
