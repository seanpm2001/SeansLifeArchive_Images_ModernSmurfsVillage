# Session 4

## July 4th 2021

I played the game again today at night, it is now a daily game.

### Early session

There was no pre-session today, I played only once today.

### Midnight session

I had a slightly longer session tonight. I grew pumpkins and did several objectives, but now I have multiple objectives to grow strawberries, which I don't have the time for at the moment, due to it taking 1 hour, and withering within 2 hours of planting.

### Tile change

I did not change my profile tile today.

### Short on coins

I spent many coins on quests and objectives, and getting my village to look better. I am now very short on coins, and I am trying to stock more coins up.

### Level progress

I leveled up to level 13 today.
