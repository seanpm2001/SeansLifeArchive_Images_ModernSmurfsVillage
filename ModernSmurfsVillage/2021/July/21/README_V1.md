# Session 21

## July 21st 2021

I played the game again today in the early afternoon, and a very long session at night.

<!-- Session notes July 8th 2021

!-->

### Early session

I had a shoter pre-session today, where I began harvesting golden corn and potatoes, and also did general collection. I also played several minigames. I did not grow raspberries, and I did some remodeling. I leveled up to level 22, and began to build stairs to the cliff region, which I will have access to in my nighttime session. I got a new hut, did some upgrades, decorated my beach a bit, polished my sanctuary and more.

I unlocked magic shrubs last night, using my first one to test it out.

### Midnight session

I had a very long session at night, making significant progress, and watching tons of ads for many smurfberries. I finally have all my huts at their fullest upgrade status.

### Crops

I grew a small variety of crops today, and made over 8000 coins from the production of golden corn. I got a profit upgrade to golden corn crops recently, so I will now be making more per crop.

At night, I grew raspberries, cucumbers, and golden corn.

### Animal sanctuary

### Visual effects

I turned visual effects back on today. I keep turning them on and off. Lately, as of the past 5 days, I have just kept them on.

### Tile change

I changed my profile tile yet again today to mix things up. I noticed a while ago that most of the games old UI appears when you go to this menu.

### Remodeling

I finally finished my beachside flower lane remodel idea, costing me tens of thousands of coins. It is finally finished. - July 18th 2021

I decorated my beach a bit today, organized a new crop dozen region, and polished my sanctuary up a bit. - July 21st 2021

### Short on coins

I spent many coins on quests and objectives several days ago, and getting my village to look better. I am now very short on coins, and I am trying to stock more coins up.

As of recently, I have stocked up thousands of coins from crop growing, but I keep blowing them instead of saving them up. This wasn't a problem until I spent over 30000 coins today. I still am working on stocking up again.

### Bridge

No recent bridge progress to display.

### Stairs

I began to build stairs today in the early afternoon, so that I can unlock the cliff region. It will be ready in tonights session. - July 21st 2021

Later on, in my nighttime session, I built the maximum amount of staircases to get it out of the way. - July 21st 2021

No other stairs data to display. - As of July 21st 2021

### Population

I reached a population of 72/70 today, I can't currently determine the exact population, as it seems to be off by 2. - July 21st 2021

I managed to upgrade all my mushroom huts to level 3 today, now I can keep on top of it, and use smurfberries for other upgrades. - July 21st 2021

### Ad problem

There is a new format of ads that started upon playing this game that I don't like (I already don't like most mobile ads to begin with, but this format is incredibly annoying) it takes me to a website that I can't navigate, sometimes the ads themselves won't load, and it will make me watch the same thing 4 times in a row, giving me the option to skip every 10 seconds. It is an extremely malicious and abusive ad format, and I question its legitimacy other than just farming ads. The site it keeps redirecting me to makes me feel like I have bad malware on my device.

There was a lesser bad format, which is literally just using PodCasts, and Soundcloud as an ad platform, which I feel is a violation of their usage. These aren't as bad, as I can just mute them, but they are still a violation of ad policies.

The issue wasn't as bad on July 9th 2021

The issue did not return on July 10th 2021

The issue returned today. Seriously, why is it still a thing? Why does it exist? - July 21st 2021

<!-- I leveled up to level 19 today, and used an ad boost to get additional XP to level up, so that I could progress through level 19 slightly faster (3% faster) !-->

<!-- I made significant progress in level 22 today, but did not level up to level 23 !-->

<!-- I did not level up today. !-->
