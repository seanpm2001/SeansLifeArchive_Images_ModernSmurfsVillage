# Session 6

## July 6th 2021

I played the game again today at night, technically on July 7th 2021.

### Early session

I did not have a pre-session today.

### Midnight session

I had a slightly longer session tonight. I did several objectives, minigames, and collection. I also started to grow Watermelon before quitting.

### Tile change

I did not change my profile tile today.

### Short on coins

I spent many coins on quests and objectives a couple days ago, and getting my village to look better. I am now very short on coins, and I am trying to stock more coins up.

### Level progress

<!-- I leveled up to level 14 today. !-->

I did not level up today.
