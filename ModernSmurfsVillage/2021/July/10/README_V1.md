# Session 10

## July 10th 2021

I played the game again today at night, technically on July 10th and July 11th 2021. I also had 1 pre-session today.

<!-- Session notes July 8th 2021

### Early session

I had a short pre-session today, and began harvesting golden corn, and beginning to grow Artichokes for a quest, and also some collection.

### Midnight session

I had a shorter session tonight. I did several objectives, minigames, and collection. I also started to grow Golden Corn before quitting.

### Crops

I grew a small variety of crops today, and made over 9000 coins from the production of golden corn.

### Animal sanctuary

I was snooping around and found out that I was capable of unlocking the animal sanctuary. I used it a bit today and made some progress.

### Visual effects

I turned visual effects back on today. I keep turning them on and off.

### Tile change

I didn't change my profile tile today. I noticed a while ago that most of the games old UI appears when you go to this menu.

### Short on coins

I spent many coins on quests and objectives several days ago, and getting my village to look better. I am now very short on coins, and I am trying to stock more coins up.

As of recently, I have stocked up thousands of coins from crop growing, but I blew most of them yesterday on beach renovations. I blew them the next day (July 11th 2021, morning) on critter food.

### Bridge

3 days ago (on Thursday, July 8th 2021), I began construction on a long bridge to reach the beach area. A couple days ago, on Friday, July 9th 2021, I unlocked the beach area, and started working on it.

### Population

I reached a population of 46-47 today, I can't currently determine the exact population.

### Ad problem

There was a new format of ads today that I highly disliked, and see as extremely ineffective and incredibly annoying. The screenshots will go into more detail on this. - July 8th 2021

The issue wasn't as bad on July 9th 2021

The issue did not return on July 10th 2021

### Level progress

<!-- I leveled up to level 18 today. !-->

I did not level up today, but I made progress in the current level.
