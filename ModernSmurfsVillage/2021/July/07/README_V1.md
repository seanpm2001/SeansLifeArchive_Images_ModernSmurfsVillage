# Session 7

## July 7th 2021

I played the game again today at night, technically on July 8th 2021.

### Early session

I had a short pre-session today, and began growing sweet potatoes.

### Midnight session

I had a longer session tonight. I did several objectives, minigames, and collection. I also started to grow Golden Corn before quitting.

### Crops

I grew a small variety of crops today, and began using flower beds.

### Visual effects

I turned visual effects back on today.

### Tile change

I changed my profile tile today to change things up. I noticed that most of the games old UI appears when you go to this menu.

### Short on coins

I spent many coins on quests and objectives a few days ago, and getting my village to look better. I am now very short on coins, and I am trying to stock more coins up.

### Level progress

<!-- I leveled up to level 14 today. !-->

I leveled up to level 15 today.

<!-- I did not level up today. !-->
