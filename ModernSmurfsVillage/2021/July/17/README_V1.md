# Session 17

## July 17th 2021

I played the game again today in the early afternoon, and a short session at night. I didn't play too much today.

<!-- Session notes July 8th 2021

!-->

### Early session

I had a short pre-session today, where I began harvesting golden corn and potatoes, and also did general collection. I also played several minigames.

### Midnight session

The midnight session was about the same. I didn't do much today.

### Crops

I grew a small variety of crops today, and made over 8000 coins from the production of golden corn. I got a profit upgrade to golden corn crops recently, so I will now be making more per crop.

### Animal sanctuary

I received another land mammal in the sanctuary today.

### Visual effects

I turned visual effects back on today. I keep turning them on and off.

### Tile change

I did not change my profile tile today. I noticed a while ago that most of the games old UI appears when you go to this menu.

### Remodeling

I did significant remodeling to the animal sanctuary 2 days ago. It looks a lot nicer now. I didn't do any remodeling to it today.

### Short on coins

I spent many coins on quests and objectives several days ago, and getting my village to look better. I am now very short on coins, and I am trying to stock more coins up.

As of recently, I have stocked up thousands of coins from crop growing, but I keep blowing them instead od saving them up.

### Bridge

No recent bridge progress to display.

### Population

I reached a population of 55-58 today, I can't currently determine the exact population, as it seems to be off by 2.

### Ad problem

There is a new format of ads that started upon playing this game that I don't like (I already don't like most mobile ads to begin with, but this format is incredibly annoying) it takes me to a website that I can't navigate, sometimes the ads themselves won't load, and it will make me watch the same thing 4 times in a row, giving me the option to skip every 10 seconds. It is an extremely malicious and abusive ad format, and I question its legitimacy other than just farming ads. The site it keeps redirecting me to makes me feel like I have bad malware on my device.

There was a lesser bad format, which is literally just using PodCasts, and Soundcloud as an ad platform, which I feel is a violation of their usage. These aren't as bad, as I can just mute them, but they are still a violation of ad policies.

The issue wasn't as bad on July 9th 2021

The issue did not return on July 10th 2021

### Level progress

<!-- I leveled up to level 18 today. !-->

<!-- I leveled up to level 19 today, and used an ad boost to get additional XP to level up, so that I could progress through level 19 slightly faster (3% faster) !-->

I made significant progress in level 20 today, but didn't level up to level 21.

<!-- I did not level up today. !-->
