## Didn't play.

I am taking another hiatus from this game, as I didn't want to continue playing this game today.

I haven't played since 2021 September 3rd (`44 days ago`) I currently don't have interest in resuming daily games at night, but I should at some point.

## When will you come back?

I have no idea. I hope to come back soon when I can find the time and interest again.

## Commit comments

**Note:** What is a period suffix? Someone mentioned it on a reply to one of my commits on 2021 September 9th (correction: September 8th, I also archived the comment on 2021 Thursday October 7th) and I couldn't figure out what it was, so I rewrote the message with better grammar and added a period to the second heading.
