# 2023, Wednesday, August 2nd

## Hiatus has ended

My hiatus from this game has finally ended. It lasted from 2021, September 3rd to 2023, August 1st (697 days, or 1 year, 10 months, and 29 days) as previously stated in the event that I return to the game, images are now being placed in a separate repository.

- [:octocat: `Click/tap here to go the 2023 August image repository`](https://github.com/seanpm2001/SeansLifeArchive_Images_ModernSmurfsVillage_Y2023_V1/)

Originally, I planned to only return with Motor World Car Factory, Smurfs Village was a successful addon to this. I have yet to resume Tiny Tower gameplay. The current repository will continue to receive daily updates, unless a decision to transition entirely is made.
