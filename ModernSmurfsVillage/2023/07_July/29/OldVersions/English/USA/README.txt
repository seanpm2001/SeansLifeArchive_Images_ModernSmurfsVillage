# 2023, Saturday, July 30th

## Didn't play.

I am taking another hiatus from this game, as I didn't want to continue playing this game today.

I haven't played since 2021 September 3rd (`694 days ago`) (Double checked as of 2023, Thursday, June 1st, last tested on 2023, Tuesday, July 25th, [[`click here to view the current amount (DuckDuckGo link)`]](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=Days+since+September+3rd+2021&t=ffab&ia=answer) I currently don't have interest in resuming daily games at night, but I should at some point.

## When will you come back?

I have no idea. I hope to come back soon when I can find the time and interest again. I am not giving up hope yet on a return.

## Hiatus (2023 June)

I took a break from updating this repository from 2023 June 2nd to 2023, June 18th, so that I can devote time to other projects. This project doesn't take much time, but it makes it so I can work on 1 less repository per day (as I am limited to 25 repositories per day) the hiatus ended on 2023, June 18th, and it took until 2023, June 23rd to get caught back up, so it is now considered a mistake to have held it off.
