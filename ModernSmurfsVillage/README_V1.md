## Modern Smurfs Village

I began to play this game again on July 1st 2021, as earlier that day, I was going through my music to try and find some good ambient music to work with that hasn't been overplayed recently. I stumbled across Smurfs Village again and got hit by a massive wave of nostalgia. I decided that I wanted to play the game again and re-experience it, so I started playing tonight after I finished my work a lot earlier than of lately. It has turned into a daily game.

I have turned it into an additional daily image project.

## What changed

I haven't played this game in at least 7 years. There were many things that have changed, but the core game seems to be mostly untouched. Some parts got "modernized" the title screen was removed, and there were other changes, and very likely many new features, but the core gameplay as I remember it is mostly the same.

## Status

I am still playing the game daily, as of July 8th 2021.
